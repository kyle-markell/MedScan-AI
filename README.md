# MedScan-AI
MedScan AI is a deep learning tool that analyzes medical images such as x-rays, MRIs, and photos to detect potential health issues and provide a diagnosis with confidence scores. Built with PyTorch and OpenCV, this model leverages pre-trained convolutional neural networks (CNNs) fine-tuned on medical datasets.
